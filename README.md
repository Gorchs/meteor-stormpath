gorchs:stormpath
A  Meteor OAuth handler package for Stormpath.

This is a fully working OAuth handler, allowing you to use Stormpath as your Meteor authentication method. If you want to use it "as is" you can just meteor add gorchs:stormpath to your application.

First of all: this package is based on robfallows great post on how to develop your own Imgur Oauth package that can be found here:

http://robfallows.github.io/2015/12/17/writing-an-oauth-2-handler.html

So, my appreciation and credits hereby.

the login package: gorchs:accounts-stormpath
